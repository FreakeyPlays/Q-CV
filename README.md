# Q-CV

## üìå - Description
Q-CV is a Software made in the Project Software Engineering and Media Computing Course at Esslingen University with the QUANTO Solutions Company.
The Software was made using the MERN-Stack and Keycloak for the Authentication.
The Software allows Users to Enter and manage User, Educations, Careers, IT-Skills and Project Data and Create CV's based on this Data.
Administrators have the ability to create and manage Users which can access the Software.

## ‚öôÔ∏è - Installation Guide
1. Clone the Git-Repository.
```
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/FreakeyPlays/Q-CV.git
```
2. Install Docker, Docker-Compose and WSL2.<br>
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
3. If ```make``` is not provided in your OS, install a custom make like GNUmake.<br>
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
4. If you don't have the provided Files of the Software (.env Files and .json Files) continue with Step 8.
5. Populate the Project with the provided Files.
   - Paste the corresponding dev.env and production.env inside of `/config`, `/client/config` and `/server/config`.<br>
   To find out which .env-File belongs in which Folder, just look at the Variables in the .env_example and the .env-Files.
   - Replace the `master-realm.json` and the `Q-CV-realm.json` in the `/realm-config` Folder.
6. Make sure you are in the Root Directory of the Repository, then build and run the Develop or Production Profile.[^1]
```
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make build-[dev|production]
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make run-[dev|production]
```
7. Continue with Step 14.
8. Create the `[dev|production].env`[^1] Files in the config Folders according to the .env_sample and the [.env Files](#%EF%B8%8F---env-files) declaration.
   - The KC_CLIENT_SECRET inside `/server/config/[dev|production].env`[^1] will be populated later.
9. Enter the `Q-CV` Folder and Build the Develop or Production Profile.[^1]
```
foo@bar:~$ cd Q-CV/
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make build-[dev|production]
```
10. After Building, serve the according Profile.[^1]
```
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make run-[dev|production]
```
11. Connect to the Keycloak Server by accessing your Address with the Keycloak Port defined in the .env file.<br>
   Default:`http://127.0.0.1:8080`
12. Retrieve the new Client Secret from the Keycloak Server.
    - Login using the Username and Password from the .env file in `/server/config/[dev|production].env`[^1].
    - Make sure you are inside the `Master` Realm (Check the name in the Top-Left corner). If you are inside another Realm, just change the realm by clicking the current name and switching to Q-CV.
    - Navigate to the Clients Section on the Left Side.
    - Select `admin-cli` in the Clients List.
    - Navigate to the `Credentials` section of the admin-cli.
    - Click the `Regenerate Secret` Button.
    - Copy the Secret from the Text field.
    - Save the Client Secret inside your `/server/config/[dev|production].env`[^1] in the KC_CLIENT_SECRET variable.
13. After setting the KC_CLIENT_SECRET restart the Containers.[^1]
```
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make stop-[dev|production]
foo@bar:~/Q-CV$ make run-[dev|production]
``` 
14. Access the Keycloak Server based on your defined Address and Port.<br>
   Default:`http://127.0.0.1:8080`
15. Create a new Temporary Administrator to access the Software and Create User.
    - Login using the Username and Password from the .env file in `/server/config/[dev|production].env`[^1].
    - Make sure you are inside the `Q-CV` Realm (Check the name in the Top-Left corner). If you are inside another Realm, just change the realm by clicking the current name and switching to Q-CV.
    - Navigate to the Users Section on the Left Side.
    - Click the `Add User` Button.
    - Provide the needed Information, add the User to the `/Admins` group and save the Information.
    - Switch to the Credentials Tab and provide a Password.
16. Access the Software based on your defined Address and Port.<br>
   Default:`http://127.0.0.1:3000`
17. Log in the Software with the Information of the Temporary Administrator.
18. Now you can create new Users which can access the complete software. Your temporary Administrator can now be deleted in the Keycloak Admin Console.
